title: About me

Howdy, I’m Paresh. I work at [BuddyBoss](https://www.buddyboss.com) and live in [Surat, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat). I am a fan of wordpress, music, and in learning new technologies. I have been solving problems as a web designer and developer professionally since 2010. An appetite for learning has led me to acquire a broad range of skills: I have built full-featured web apps, designed front-end interfaces.

I believes that open source is the future of web, and that an open future is built on reciprocal volunteerism.
