intrest: In my spare time, I spend time reading tech blogs and books as a way to keep learning and becoming better. I enjoy watching video of JSConf, WordPress.TV, GOTO Conference, PHP Conference and WeAreDeveloper Conference. My favorite professional and hobbyist coder’s YouTube channels are Fun Fun Functions, Wes Bos, CS Dojo, LevelUp Tuts and The Coding Train.
  When I’m not deep in code crafting websites or learning new web technologies, I enjoy good food, exploring my surrounding, outing with my wife and read some mathematics books.
